# My keyboard layout

## Overview

A 34 keys split keyboard layout implemented with [ZMK](https://zmk.dev/).

The layout is designed for a keyboard with 3x5 main keys plus 2 thumb keys per split (e.g. [Sweep Keyboard](https://github.com/davidphilipbarr/Sweep)) and optimized to use VIM and tmux in macOS.
