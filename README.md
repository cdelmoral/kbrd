# My keyboard layout

## Overview

A 36 keys split keyboard layout implemented with [ZMK](https://zmk.dev/).

The layout is designed for a keyboard with 3x5 main keys plus 3 thumb keys per split
(e.g. [Corne Keyboard](https://github.com/foostan/crkbd)) and optimized to use VIM and tmux in macOS.

## Layout

The layout design tries to adhere to the following concepts as much as possible:

- Familiarity with a standard keyboard
- Avoid complexity as much as possible
- Ergonomic design
- Wireless ready
